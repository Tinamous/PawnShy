# Case

## Contents

The case consists of the following parts.

* MainBody - This is the large body containing the Rasberry Pi, NFC reader.
* LEDHolder - This bolts on opt of the main body (use M3 counter sunk machine screws).
* PawnStand - Sits on inside the LED holder, has 26mm pockets to hold the pawns.

Inside the main body the NFC sensor is attached to the front panel by 4x M3 countersunk machine screws. You can use either heatfit inserts into the holder or long bolts (15+mm) and nuts.

The Raspberry Pi is attached inside the back panel with standoffs. It is expected the power cable goes up from the Pi inside the case and then down and out through the hole in the back (or to an internal battery).

The sensor holder has mointing points well outside the main body area to allow for different RFID/NFC sensors that might be large.

Two sensor holders are provided:

* MicroNFCBoardCase - This is for the MicroNFCBoard (https://www.seeedstudio.com/Micro-NFC-Board-p-2431.html)
* UniversalRfidCase - For IB Technology (Eccel) Micro RWD Universal PCB (http://www.ibtechnology.co.uk/rfid-readers/)

Optional base:

* Base - Holds a USB battery pack, allows for stick feet and a stand for a phone to help align with the NFC sensor.

## Printing

All parts can be printed on a FDM 3D Printer. 

My settings:

* Printer: Ultimaker 2 Extended+
* Nozzle: 0.6mm (0.4 should be fine, I used 0.6 as my 0.4 is trashed and 0.6 is faster).
* Adhesion: Brim (Optional)
* Layer Height: 0.2mm
* Wall thickness: 1.59mm
* Top/Bottom thickness: 1.2mm
* Infill Density: 20%
* Supports: No (Ensure models are flipped as needed).

None of these settings are critical.

Most parts will need rotating 180° to ensure the flat side is against the bed.
